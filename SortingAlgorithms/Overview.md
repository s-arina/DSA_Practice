# Overview of Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top.

- checks two numbers against each other to see which is the larger one
- larger gets swapped to the right position
- when it reaches the end, the last number gets locked in
- process repeats again for the rest of the numbers

1. Loop over elements
2. Swap anything out of order
3. Repeat 1-2 until there are no swaps
