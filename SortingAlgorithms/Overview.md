# Overview of Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top. It works well with nearly sorted data.

- checks two numbers against each other to see which is the larger one
- larger gets swapped to the right position
- when it reaches the end, the last number gets locked in
- process repeats again for the rest of the numbers

1. Loop over elements
2. Swap anything out of order
3. Repeat 1-2 until there are no swaps

> > Time Complexity

- O(n) – (best)
- O(n^2) – (average/worst)

> > Space Complexity

- O(1)

## Selection Sort

Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first putting large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position.

- store the first element as the min (smallest) value (index position)
- compare this to the next value in the array until you find a smaller value
- if a smaller value is found, set that to be new min
- if the min is not the first min you started with, swap the two values
- repeat until sorted, starting from the next element
